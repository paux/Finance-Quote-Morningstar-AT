=head1 NAME

`Finance::Quote::Morningstar::AT` - Obtain fund prices from
http://Morningstar.AT/

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Quote;

    $q = Finance::Quote->new;

    %fundinfo = $q->fetch("morningstar_at","morningstar fund id");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module obtains information about fund prices from
www.morningstar.at. It has been forked from `Morningstar.pm` which is
distributed with `Finance::Quote`.

This module is especially useful for locally (European) managed funds
that are unknown to US sites.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Have `Finance::Quote` installed. In Debian and derivatives this is the package
`libfinance-quote-perl`; it also gets installed with GnuCash.

Then put the module `AT.pm` into the directory `Finance/Quote/Morningstar/`
of your local Perl library directory, e.g.:

    $ cd $USERLIB         # e.g. /usr/local/lib
    $ mkdir perl          # unless exists
    $ mkdir perl/$version # same as in /usr/lib/perl
    $ mkdir -p perl/$version/Finance/Quote/Morningstar

Copy `Quote.pm` from `Finance::Quote`, usually located at
`/usr/lib/perl/$version/Finance/`, into `$USERLIB/perl/$version/Finance/` and edit it:
Add `Morningstar::AT` to `@modules` (search for `Morningstar`).

=head2 Testing

1. Be sure your local Perl library directory version matches your actual Perl version:
    $ ls -d /usr/lib/perl
    $ ls -d $USERLIB/perl    # e.g. /usr/local/lib
2. `perl -e 'use Finance::Quote::Morningstar::AT'` should not display anything,
especially no error.
3. If you want to use the module with GnuCash, execute
    $ gnc-fq-dump | grep --color=auto morningstar
You should see both `morningstar` and `morningstar_at`.
